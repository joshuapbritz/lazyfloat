# LazyFloat
LazyFloat is a TUI inspired by lazydocker and lazygit that I am building as part of my journey into learning Rust. My goal with this is to integrate with the float.com API to give developers a terminal based way of logging time with float. 

## Setting up
Start by cloning this repository to your machine. Ensure you have the Rust language installed. This can be easily installed via homebrew:

```bash
brew install rust
```

In the root of the project, you can run the application by running `cargo run`.
